data need to be store in a data structure.
no data structure are perfect, need to choose right one for your need.

the way we measure how good is data structure is for doing specific things
such as retriving data, insert data, search data, sorting data is called
Big o notation.
(Big o help to find data structure performence)

data structure :

1 - linked lists
2 - array
3 - hash table (dic in python) - keys of dic go to a hashing function and
    that return a mem location of value of that key (mem locations are not
    in order)
4 - stack - last in first out (use by algorithm dfs)
5 - queue - fitst in first out (use by algorithm bfs)
6 - graphs - nodes poits to another points (here pointer are called "edges")
7 - trees
  7.1 - binary search tree (good for search)
  7.2 - self-balance tree
